# Paths Finder

Welcome! This is the documentation for Paths Finders, a web application that offers an intuitive experience for running pathfinding algorithms on an interactive graph.

## Introduction

Paths Finder provides a simple and intuitive interface for running pathfinding algorithms on graphs of various sizes. Its ease of use makes it an ideal tool for exploring and analyzing any desired paths.

## Usage

### Algorithm Selection

On the "App" page, you can select the type of algorithm you want from a dropdown menu. The available algorithm types include:

- Dijkstra;
- Directed Dijkstra;
- Bellman-Ford;
- Directed Bellman-Ford.

### Graph Construction

Once the desired algorithm is selected, you can construct an interactive graph by dragging and dropping nodes and creating connections between them.

### Running the Algorithm

After building the graph, press the "Run Algorithm" button to execute the selected algorithm on the graph.

### Viewing Results

Once the algorithm is executed, you can view the found path in the graph, along with all other secondary paths with the same cost.

## Additional Actions

In addition to running the algorithm, you can perform the following actions on the graph via the respective buttons:

- **Center Graph**: Centers the graph in the viewing area;
- **Add Node**: Adds a new node to the graph;
- **Remove Node**: Removes a selected node from the graph;
- **Remove Edge**: Removes a selected edge from the graph;
- **Remove All Connections**: Removes all connections present in the graph;
- **Remove All Nodes**: Removes all nodes present in the graph.

## Rules and Options

Upon loading the page, rules and options are displayed based on the type of device being used. The rules include tips on how to interact with the graph and the available options via certain keys.

### Rules for Desktop

- Use "backspace" to remove selected nodes and edges.
- Edit edge weights by double-clicking on them and selecting the correct value.
- Add more nodes by double-clicking on the worksheet.
- Connect nodes by first double-clicking on the source node and then clicking on the destination node.
- When ready to start, press "enter" to view the algorithm results.

### Rules for Mobile Devices

- Edit edge weights by double-tapping on them and selecting the correct value.
- Add more nodes by double-tapping on the worksheet.
- Connect nodes by first double-tapping on the source node and then tapping on the destination node.
